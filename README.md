## Changes Made From Tutorial
1. Watermelons are in the game! They have a 15% chance to spawn when you launch a projectile. When they land they explode.
2. There is a game over screen.
3. There are 4 unique levels each with their own difficulty.
4. There is a reset level button in case you get stuck. (This does not reset your launch count!)
5. There are three new sounds in the game: rubberband lauching, goal "ga-ding", and an explosion.
